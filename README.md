Problem Statement

British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

BA wants to understand their customers behavior to act proactively in order to acquire more customers before they embark on their holiday. Therefore, they want to build a predictive model that can help them know if their customers will be purchasing flights through them, & understand the key factors behind their decisions.

For the predicitve model, the dataset is provided by British Airways. It contains historical customer booking data.
